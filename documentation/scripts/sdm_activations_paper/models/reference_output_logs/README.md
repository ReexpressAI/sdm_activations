# Training Logs

For reference and comparison, we include the output to standard out for the SDM estimator training runs using Phi-3.5-instruct over the Factcheck and Sentiment datasets. This uses the current version of the code run on an A100 GPU and the provided run scripts. The experiments in the paper used an earlier, non-GPU-optimized version of the code[^1], but the numerical differences with this updated and refactored version are within the resolution of the comparisons of the original experiments.

[^1]: This was based on the earlier Reexpress MCP Server v.1.2.0 branch of the code base, but with the simplified formulation of the SDM estimator presented in the paper.
